# Filter design by optimization
This code finds the factors of fir digital filters transfer functions using Traditional Particle Swarm and Tribes variation optimization algorithms.
It uses the general polynomial of analog filters transfer function.

## Instalation

This code only uses three libraries, [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.1/index.html), [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/index.html). Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
